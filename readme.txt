== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can’t see the vote links =

Users cannot vote for themselves.  If you are the author of a topic or reply, the vote links won’t be available; the score only will be shown.

= Can I filter the query to sort posts by votes ? =

Yes, you can sort the posts by score or votes count, using the query variable 'bbpvote_sort'.
Allowed values are 'score_desc', 'score_asc', 'count_desc', 'count_asc'.

Example of a [query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) that will fetch the 5 last topics, ordered by score (desc) : 

`<?php
$best_rated_topics_args = array(
  'post_type'       => bbp_topic_post_type(), //or 'topic'
  'posts_per_page'  => 5,
  'bbpvote_sort'       => 'score_desc' //plugin
);

$best_rated_topics = new WP_Query( $best_rated_topics_args );
?>`

See function sort_by_votes() for more details.

= How can I customize the look of the vote links ? =

The best way to customize the links is to setup some CSS rules in your theme.
Check [this example on CodePen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KpwrMp) to see how to have images displayed instead of text.

If you need more complex customization, you can filter the links using those hooks :

*   bbpvotes_get_vote_up_link
*   bbpvotes_get_vote_down_link
*   bbpvotes_get_vote_score_link
